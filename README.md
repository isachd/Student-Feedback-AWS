# Student Feedback System
This project is a dynamic Node.js application. It is built using Node.js Express Framework and MongoDB as database. Passport.js library is used for secure authentication of the user. Nodemailer module is used for secure verification of user via email and functionality like forgot password. This system has 2 portals. One for the students where student can give there feedback and other is for the  admin where he can see all the feedback comments and google graph library is used to show a graph on admin page.

# Hosted App

 1. For email purposes Mailgun is used. I have used the sandbox in mailgun, so for sending mails, i need to first add the mails of the recipients. So, probably, this app may not work for you, as to create new user, your email needs to be verified.
 
 2. Admin does not have to undergo the registration process.
